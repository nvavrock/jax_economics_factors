✅ Jacksonville Household Economic Stress App
Phase 1 — Foundation Checklist

We do not skip steps.
We do not optimize early.

☑️ CHECKLIST 1: PostgreSQL Ready

Goal: You can store, retrieve, and trust your data.

 PostgreSQL installed and running

 Database created: jacksonville_econ

 Can connect via:

 psql or

 DBeaver / pgAdmin

 Tables created:

 econ_raw

 econ_metrics

 household_stress_index

 agent_summaries

 You can run:

SELECT * FROM econ_raw;


📌 Stop here until all boxes are checked.

☑️ CHECKLIST 2: R → PostgreSQL Connection

Goal: R can write to and read from Postgres.

 Install R packages:

DBI

RPostgres

tidycensus

tidyverse

 Create a DB connection in R

 Test insert into econ_raw

 Test select from econ_raw

If this fails, nothing else matters yet.

☑️ CHECKLIST 3: ACS Data Ingestion (Rent & Income)

Goal: Get real Jacksonville data into Postgres.

 Register Census API key

 Pull ACS data for:

Duval

Clay

Nassau

St. Johns

 Variables:

Median rent

Median household income

Number of households

 Insert raw values into econ_raw

📌 Raw means no math yet.

☑️ CHECKLIST 4: Metric Calculation (Rent Burden)

Goal: Turn raw data into a defensible metric.

 Calculate rent-to-income ratio per county

 Apply household-weighted metro aggregation

 Store result in econ_metrics

 Confirm values look sane (no negatives, no 10x spikes)

☑️ CHECKLIST 5: Stress Index (v1)

Goal: Produce ONE number per month.

 Normalize metric (z-score or percentile)

 Apply weight (35%)

 Compute stress score

 Assign stress level:

Low

Moderate

High

Severe

 Insert into household_stress_index

☑️ CHECKLIST 6: First Agent Run (No UI)

Goal: Generate a human explanation.

 Pull latest stress score from Postgres

 Pull last month’s score

 Build structured input

 Generate explanation with LLM

 Save output in agent_summaries

📌 If this works, you have an agentic system.

☑️ CHECKLIST 7: Minimal Shiny UI

Goal: See it working.

 Line chart: stress score over time

 Text block: agent summary

 Dropdown: date selection (optional)

No filters. No polish.
