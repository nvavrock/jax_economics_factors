📊 Jacksonville Household Economic Stress App
Project Status & Remaining Milestones
Current Progress: [PAUSED]
Database: PostgreSQL postgres is live with all 4 schema tables created.

Connection: R is successfully talking to Postgres via DBI/odbc.

Security: Credentials moved to .Renviron for safety.

Stuck at: Finalizing the jax_raw data pull from the Census API.

PHASE 1: THE REMAINING FOUNDATION
Goal: Get the data into the database.

[ ] Fix Census Pull: Ensure jax_raw exists in the R Environment.

[ ] Clean & Format: Rename columns to variable, value, region, and date.

[ ] Database Write: Execute dbWriteTable(con, "econ_raw", formatted_data, append = TRUE).

[ ] Verification: Confirm data is visible in the CLI via SELECT * FROM econ_raw;.

PHASE 2: CALCULATED METRICS (The Logic)
Goal: Turn raw numbers into "Stress Scores."

[ ] Calculate Rent-to-Income Ratio: Create a script that pulls the two variables and divides them.

[ ] Write to econ_metrics: Store these calculated ratios back in the database.

[ ] Index Creation: Normalize the data (0-100 scale) and store in household_stress_index.

[ ] Agent Summaries: Generate a high-level "Jacksonville North" vs. "Jacksonville South" summary.

PHASE 3: SHINY DASHBOARD (The Visuals)
Goal: Make it useful for a human.

[ ] App Layout: Create the ui.R (Sidebar for counties, main panel for charts).

[ ] Server Logic: Write server.R to query the database based on user selection.

[ ] Visualization: Build a Plotly or ggplot graph showing stress trends by region.

[ ] Map (V2 Target): Integrating a leaflet map of Jacksonville.

💡 Technical Notes for Next Session
Granularity Note: The current script uses County-level data (Duval, Clay, Nassau, St. Johns). To see neighborhood-level "pockets," we will need to change geography = "county" to geography = "tract" in the future.

The + Symbol: If the R console shows a +, press ESC to reset it.

Variable Names: * B19013_001 = Median Household Income

B25064_001 = Median Gross Rent
