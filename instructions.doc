Do not start with:

“All economic conditions”

Multiple dashboards

Multiple agents

Fancy UI

That’s how good ideas die.

You need one narrow economic question, one data pipeline, one agent loop.

Step 1 — Pick ONE Economic Question (this week)

Your app should answer one question better than anyone else.

Good starter questions (choose ONE):

Option A (Strongest for you)

“What is the real economic stress on households right now?”

Signals:

Rent vs income

Credit card balances

Delinquencies

Inflation-adjusted wages

Housing affordability

Why this fits you:

Data-heavy

Narrative-driven

Perfect for agent summaries

Strong freelance / consulting value

Option B

“Is the housing market actually healthy in my metro area?”

Signals:

Price vs wage growth

Mortgage rates

Inventory

Days on market

Delinquencies / foreclosures

You’ve already leaned this direction before — this is a natural continuation.

Option C

“Are we entering a recession — yes or no?”

Harder, but very agent-friendly.

👉 Do not proceed until you pick ONE.
Everything else depends on it.

Step 2 — Define Your FIRST Agent (not many)

Agentic ≠ many agents
Agentic = loop + memory + decision-making

Your first agent should do ONE thing:

Ingest data → analyze → explain like a human economist

Example:

“Economic Conditions Analyst Agent”

Responsibilities:

Pull latest data

Compare vs historical baseline

Flag anomalies

Write a plain-English summary

No tools yet. No web UI yet.

Step 3 — Data Pipeline First (before UI)

This is where your stack shines.

Canonical pipeline
Raw Data
↓
PostgreSQL
↓
Python / R Analysis
↓
Agent Summary
↓
UI

Data sources to start with (pick 2 max):

FRED (macro)

Census / ACS (income, housing)

BLS (CPI, wages)

Use:

R → ingestion & cleaning (tidycensus, tidyverse)

PostgreSQL → single source of truth

Python → orchestration + agents

📌 Do NOT mix ingestion logic into the agent.

Step 4 — Minimal Agent Architecture (important)

You do NOT need LangChain chaos.

Simple, clean agent loop:
1. Fetch latest data snapshot
2. Run deterministic analysis
3. Generate structured facts
4. LLM turns facts → narrative
5. Store output + timestamp


Your agent:

Does not “think”

Explains results

Keeps historical memory

Memory = PostgreSQL table.

Step 5 — First UI (keep it boring)
Best starting UI for your stack:

Shiny → embedded summaries

Why:

You already know R

Fast iteration

Great for econ dashboards

Can call Python via API later

Initial UI:

1 dashboard

1 chart

1 agent-generated summary

That’s it.

Step 6 — Where Cursor & UV Fit
Cursor

Write analysis faster

Refactor pipelines

Generate test cases

Document models

UV

Lock Python deps early

Reproducibility matters for economics apps

You’re already ahead by using UV.

Step 7 — Only THEN add “Agentic” Depth

Once your first agent works:

Add:

Second agent: “Skeptical Economist”

Challenges assumptions

Alert agent:

“Something changed materially this week”

Scenario agent:

“If rates drop 1%, what breaks?”

Each agent:

Same data

Different mandate

No shared hallucinations

What This Becomes (realistically)

If done right, this turns into:

A credible economic intelligence app

A freelance product

A consulting demo

A portfolio anchor

Not a toy dashboard.
